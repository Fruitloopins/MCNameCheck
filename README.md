# MCNameCheck
**I AM NOT CERTAIN THIS WORKS, YOU ARE FREE TO VERIFY IT.**

Constantly checks a set of provided Minecraft UUIDs for changes to their associated username.

Useful for name sniping on a small scale if you want to know (close to) the exact time the name was changed as Mojang no longer provides an API route for this information.
